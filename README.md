# Structured-programming-basic/two swap.c
The provided code demonstrates how to swap the values of two numbers without using a temporary variable in c. 
The swapNumbers() function takes two integers a and b, and swaps their values using a simple mathematical calculation. 
The main() function prompts the user to enter two numbers, then calls the swapNumbers() function to swap the values and prints the result.

# Structured-programming-basic/remainder.c
This one demonstrates how to calculate the remainder of a division calculation in c.
The Remainder() function takes two integers, dividend and divisor, and returns the remainder.
The main() function helps the user to enter the dividend and divisor, calls the Remainder() function, and prints the result.

# Structured-programming-basic/sum.c
The code demonstrates how to calculate the sum of the digits in a three-digit number in c.
The calculateDigitSum() function takes an integer M, which represents the three-digit number, and returns the sum of its digits. 
The main() function prompts the user to enter a three-digit number, calls the calculateDigitSum() function, and prints the result.

# Structured-programming-basic/problem 1.c
The code calculates the credit card balance and total amount paid over a 12 months period.
It takes in the initial balance, annual interest rate, and monthly payment rate as input.
The key steps are:
It calculates the monthly interest rate from the annual interest rate.
It then loops through each of the 12 months.
For each month, it calculates the minimum payment, the unpaid balance, the interest, and the new balance.
It also tracks the total amount paid.
Finally, it prints out the monthly details and the final total paid and remaining the balance.
